## 🎯 Personal Blog Goals (2025–2026)

1. **Interactive Lessons**  
   - Embed **Mermaid diagrams**, **live code snippets**, and **interactive games** (like Pong and Snake) so students can engage directly with content.  
   - Ensure lessons are **responsive** and work well on both desktop and mobile.  

2. **Project-Based Learning Support**  
   - Provide ready-to-use **debugging challenges** for CSP and CSSE students.  
   - Include **step-by-step guides, GitHub issues templates, and evaluation matrices** for each project.  

3. **Collaboration Tools Integration**  
   - Maintain compatibility with **VS Code Live Share** for pair/trio programming sessions.  
   - Ensure GitHub workflows are clear: Kanban boards, burndown lists, and PR reviews.  

4. **Resource Hub for Students**  
   - Serve as a central location for **lesson plans, tutorials, and code examples**.  
   - Allow students to **fork projects**, track bugs, and practice debugging independently.  

5. **Continuous Improvement & Updates**  
   - Refresh lessons yearly to include **new coding techniques and CS trends**.  
   - Collect student feedback and iterate on lessons, challenges, and examples.  

6. **Showcase My Work**  
   - Document **progress on projects like Pong and Snake**.  
   - Share reflections, insights, and teaching strategies for **peer review and mentoring**.  


# 🚀 Progress Update: Pong Debugging Lesson  

Over the past week, I’ve made significant progress on my **Computer Science project-based learning tools**. My goal has been to create engaging activities that blend coding, debugging, and collaboration using classic arcade games.

## 🎮 Building the Pong Game  

I started by coding a **Pong Game in JavaScript and HTML Canvas**. The game includes:  
- Two paddles controlled by **W/S keys** (left) and **Arrow keys** (right).  
- A ball that bounces off walls and paddles.  
- A simple **scoring system**.  
- Real-time updates with `setInterval(loop, 1000/60)` for smooth gameplay.  

This gave me a working foundation to design a debugging-focused classroom activity. Students can immediately see how small code changes affect gameplay, which makes it perfect for learning **pair/trio programming**.

## 📚 Creating the Debugging Lesson  

Using the Snake Game Debugging template I had before, I adapted it into a **Pong Debugging Lesson**. The structure includes:  

- **Pair/Trio Programming Overview** → Introduction to Agile-style collaboration.  
- **Pong Debugging Session** → Students work through real issues in the Pong code.  
- **Debugging Workflow (Mermaid diagram)** → Visual map of the problem-solving cycle.  
- **GitHub Issues + Burndown Planning** → Students learn to track bugs like real developers.  
- **Driver/Navigator/Observer Roles** → Rotation system to keep all teammates engaged.  
- **Evaluation Table** → Tracks performance across planning, coding, and code review.  
- **Reflection Questions** → Students think critically about debugging strategies.  

I also included **direct navigation links** at the top of the lesson so students can jump between sections easily — almost like an interactive manual.

## 🛠️ Tools Up and Running  

To make this all possible, I’ve been setting up and testing my development tools:  

- **GitHub Issues + Kanban** → Students document and manage bugs.  
- **Live Share (VS Code)** → Enables real-time collaboration for driver/navigator debugging.  
- **Mermaid Diagrams** → Used to clearly show the debugging workflow.  
- **Markdown Lessons** → Organized and published as blog-style resources for easy student access.  

Everything is now connected and working together. This means students can **code, debug, and collaborate** in a realistic development environment — but with the fun of debugging a retro game.  

---

## ✨ Next Steps  

- Add **intentional bug injections** into Pong (e.g., ball not resetting, paddle slipping out of bounds, or score not updating).  
- Create a **GitHub Classroom repo** preloaded with Pong so students fork and start debugging.  
- Collect student feedback after the first run of the activity.

## 💡 Reflection  

Looking back, I’m excited about how far I’ve come. From coding the **Pong game from scratch** to adapting a **debugging lesson template**, I now have a **complete learning activity** that blends fun, coding, and real-world workflows.  

This project has helped me strengthen my own coding, teaching, and project management skills — and I can’t wait to see how students respond to it.
